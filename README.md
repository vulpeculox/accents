# Accents
Universal single key accenting in Javascript and AHK  http://vulpeculox.net/ax

Accents are a pain but this solution uses a single key for ALL accents.  The demo page is at http://vulpeculox.net/ax/js.htm 
This is implemented in Javascript and also, for Windows only, AutoHotkey.

The principle is very simple. Place the cursor to the right of a character to be modified then press F8. This changes the character. Press again for the next accent and so on in a cycle. This works for fresh typing or editing. 

Anyone with a multi-lingual or cross-lingual website where the required keys are likely not available or fiendishly complicated can plug ax.js in in minutes.

Language cycles can be easily switched and developers can easily edit them too.  You're not limited to F8.  Instructions for end-users are very simple too.

### Example language cycles
(Can't show them in markdown.)  Look at the current list http://vulpeculox.net/ax/js.htm 


## Community-driven language cycles 
As a wider range of people get to use AX they adapt the language cycles and give them back for others to use.
**As at December 2018** cycles need to be attached to emails to ax@vulpeculox.net to be incorporated in the next release.  *If somebody can explain how to use Github to manage this process then that would be great.*
